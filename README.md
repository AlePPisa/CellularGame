# Cellular
A short game created in 48 hours by Stephan, Alessandro and Luis. The aim was to practice for the upcoming GMTK Gamejam 2021. Unfortunatley due to circumstances we were unable to participate in the GMTK gamejam, but this game was still a complete joy to make!

### The Game
A cellular autonoma like puzzle game, where the goal (the resulting board) is given to you! Your aim is to work your way backwards in order to find the initial state of the board. Then run the simulation in order to prove your worth! I am writing this a time later, so I am not entirerly sure, but I believe there are 20 levels, with the last one being a sandbox mode with unlimited attempts.

### Some Bugs
- You are allowed to place cells after having started the simulation.
- One of the levels has 200 steps instead of 2.
- UI does not resize properly on different screen sizes.
- Some sexy buggy animations.

### Credits
- Music by Luis
- Code by Stephan (most of it) and Alessandro (not most of it)
